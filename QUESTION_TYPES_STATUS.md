# Question Types Status Report

## What's Working ✅
1. **Multiple Choice** - Fully working on both instructor and student sides
2. **True/False** - Fully working on both instructor and student sides
3. **Question Set Management Page** - New full-page UI for managing saved question sets

## What's NOT Working ❌

### 1. Matching Questions
**Problem:** Not displaying on either instructor or student side

**Root Cause:**
- Data structure mismatch between creation and display
- Created as `pairs: [{left, right}]` format
- Display code expects this but may not be getting it from backend

**Needs:**
- Backend verification: Check what `currentQuestion` contains in database
- Student interface: `UnifiedQuestionDisplay.tsx` needs matching question component
- Instructor display: Should be working with current code but needs testing

### 2. Ordering Questions
**Problem:** Not showing items to order on either side

**Root Cause:**
- Created as `correctOrder: [items]` array
- Display tries to read `items`, `correctOrder`, or `options`
- May not be sent correctly to backend

**Needs:**
- Backend verification: Check field names being stored
- Student interface: `UnifiedQuestionDisplay.tsx` needs ordering question component
- Data normalization when sending

### 3. Fill-in-Blank Questions
**Problem:** Shows literal "[blank]" text instead of input field

**Root Cause:**
- Question text contains "[blank]" placeholder
- Student interface doesn't parse and replace with input field
- Instructor display doesn't need input, just shows text (correct)

**Needs:**
- Student interface: Parse question text, replace "[blank]" with `<input>` field
- Collect typed answer and submit

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check What's Being Saved
Open browser console when creating a question and look for:
```
Sending question to backend: {...}
```

Verify the object has:
- **Matching**: `leftColumn`, `rightColumn`, `pairs`
- **Ordering**: `items`, `correctOrder`
- **Fill-blank**: `questionText` with "[blank]", `correctAnswer`

### Step 2: Check What Backend Returns
In display view console, when question appears:
```
Current question: {...}
```

Verify backend is returning the same fields.

### Step 3: Student Interface
The student portal (`cloud-student-portal`) needs major updates to `UnifiedQuestionDisplay.tsx`:

**Required Changes:**
```typescript
// Add matching component
if (questionType === 'matching') {
  // Show two columns
  // Collect user selections
  // Submit pairs as answer
}

// Add ordering component
if (questionType === 'ordering') {
  // Show drag-and-drop or select interface
  // Collect final order
  // Submit as array
}

// Add fill-blank parsing
if (questionType === 'fill_blank') {
  // Parse questionText
  // Replace [blank] with <input>
  // Collect input value as answer
}
```

## Temporary Workaround

Until student interface is fixed:
- Stick to Multiple Choice and True/False questions
- These work perfectly for lectures

## Files That Need Changes

### Instructor Side (Mostly Done)
- ✅ `display.html` - Question display logic
- ✅ `create-session.html` - Question creation
- ✅ `saved-questions.html` - Management UI

### Student Side (Needs Major Work)
- ❌ `/cloud-student-portal/src/components/UnifiedQuestionDisplay.tsx` - Display all types
- ❌ Needs React components for:
  - Matching interface (select from dropdowns or drag-drop)
  - Ordering interface (drag-drop or number inputs)
  - Fill-blank input field parsing

### Backend (Needs Verification)
- ❓ `/routes/sessions.js` - May need field name standardization
- ❓ Verify what's stored vs what's retrieved

## Next Steps Priority

1. **HIGH**: Add console logging to see exact data flow
2. **HIGH**: Fix student interface for fill-in-blank (easiest)
3. **MEDIUM**: Add matching/ordering React components to student interface
4. **LOW**: Verify backend field consistency

## Quick Test Instructions

### To test if data is being saved correctly:

1. Create a matching question
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click "Add This Question"
4. Look for log showing the question object
5. Check if it has `pairs` or `leftColumn`/`rightColumn`

### To test if data reaches display:

1. Start session with the question
2. Click "Next Question" in display view
3. Check console for "Sending question to backend"
4. Check if the data structure matches what was created

### To test student interface:

Currently won't work for matching/ordering/fill-blank until TypeScript components are added.
