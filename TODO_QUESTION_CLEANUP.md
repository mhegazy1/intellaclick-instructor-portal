# Questions to Revisit and Clean Up

## Date: October 12, 2025

### Issues to Address Later:

#### 1. Matching Questions
- **Current Status**: Working, shows results after question ends
- **Issues to Clean Up**:
  - Need to verify all result formats display correctly
  - Check edge cases (empty answers, partial matches)
  - Ensure color coding is consistent

#### 2. Ordering Questions
- **Current Status**: Shuffles on student side, shows correct order on instructor side
- **Issues to Clean Up**:
  - Correct order badges may not always appear (needs debugging)
  - Need to verify data format consistency from backend
  - Check console logs to diagnose display issues

#### 3. Fill in the Blank Questions
- **Current Status**: Basic functionality working
- **Issues to Clean Up**:
  - Review answer display format
  - Check how multiple blanks are handled
  - Verify grading logic

### Next Steps:
1. After addressing critical features (question sets saving, session history)
2. Run systematic tests on each question type
3. Review console logs for each type
4. Fix any edge cases or display issues

### Priority: LOW (after critical features are completed)
